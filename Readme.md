# Teams Management API
![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-work%20in%20progress-orange)

A **production‑ready Team Management REST API** built with **ASP.NET Core (.NET 8)** following **Clean / Onion Architecture** principles. The API manages **organizations, teams, users, projects, and tasks** with full lifecycle support, **soft deletion**, and clear separation of concerns.

This project is designed to be **CV‑ready**: clean architecture, scalable structure, and real‑world domain modeling.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* Clean **Onion Architecture** with strict dependency rules
* Rich domain model (Organizations, Teams, Projects, Tasks, Users)
* **Soft delete & restore** across all aggregates
* Repository + Unit of Work patterns
* DTO-based API contracts 
* EF Core code-first with migrations
* Designed for extensibility and testability

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

This project follows **Onion Architecture**, where **dependencies always point inward** toward the domain. The domain layer is completely independent of frameworks and infrastructure concerns.
---

## 🧠 Domain Model

### Core Entities

* **Organization** → owns Users & Teams
* **Team** → belongs to Organization, contains Members & Projects
* **User** → belongs to Organization, can join multiple Teams
* **Project** → belongs to a Team, contains Tasks
* **Task** → belongs to Project, optionally assigned to a User

### Base Entity

All main entities inherit:

* `Id`
* `CreatedAt`
* `UpdatedAt`
* `IsDeleted` (soft delete)

---

## 🔁 Soft Delete Strategy

* `PATCH /soft-delete` → sets `IsDeleted = true`
* `PATCH /restore` → restores entity
* `GET /deleted` → fetch soft‑deleted records
*
