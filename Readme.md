A **production‑ready Team Management REST API** built with **ASP.NET Core (.NET 8)** following **Clean / Onion Architecture** principles. The API manages **organizations, teams, users, projects, and tasks** with full lifecycle support, **soft deletion**, and clear separation of concerns.

This project is designed to be **CV‑ready**: clean architecture, scalable structure, and real‑world domain modeling.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* Clean **Onion Architecture** with strict dependency rules
* Rich domain model (Organizations, Teams, Projects, Tasks, Users)
* **Soft delete & restore** across all aggregates
* Repository + Unit of Work patterns
* DTO-based API contracts 
* EF Core code-first with migrations
* Designed for extensibility and testability

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

This project follows **Onion Architecture**, where **dependencies always point inward** toward the domain. The domain layer is completely independent of frameworks and infrastructure concerns.
---

## 🧠 Domain Model

### Core Entities

* **Organization** → owns Users & Teams
* **Team** → belongs to Organization, contains Members & Projects
* **User** → belongs to Organization, can join multiple Teams
* **Project** → belongs to a Team, contains Tasks
* **Task** → belongs to Project, optionally assigned to a User

### Base Entity

All main entities inherit:

* `Id`
* `CreatedAt`
* `UpdatedAt`
* `IsDeleted` (soft delete)

---

## 🔁 Soft Delete Strategy

Soft deletion is implemented consistently across all aggregates.

### Behavior

- Soft delete sets `IsDeleted = true`
- Restore clears `IsDeleted`
- Deleted records are excluded from normal queries
- Dedicated endpoints expose deleted data

### Endpoints Pattern

- `PATCH /{entity}/{id}/soft-delete`
- `PATCH /{entity}/{id}/restore`
- `GET /{entity}/deleted`
